# komitto (commit)

[English](./README.md) | [日本語](./README-ja.md)

A CLI tool for generating semantic commit message prompts from `git diff` information. The generated prompt is automatically copied to the clipboard, allowing you to paste it into an LLM to create your commit message.

## Key Features

- Analyzes staged changes (`git diff --staged`) and optionally compares multiple contexts.
- Converts change details into a structured XML/JSON format that LLMs can understand.
- **LLM API Integration**: Directly calls APIs from providers like OpenAI, Gemini, Anthropic, Ollama, etc., using settings defined in `komitto.toml`.
- **Contextual Understanding**: Automatically includes recent commit logs in the prompt to preserve project context and style.
- Combines with system prompts specifically designed for commit message generation; templates can be overridden per‑context, per‑template, or per‑model.
- Copies the final generated prompt (or raw LLM output) to the clipboard.
- Provides functionality to attach additional context about the changes via command-line arguments.
- **Interactive Mode** (`-i`/`--interactive`): Review, edit, regenerate, or commit the generated message in a REPL‑style loop.
- **Editor Integration**: Edit the commit message using your preferred editor (VISUAL/EDITOR/GIT_EDITOR).
- **Robust Error Handling**: Gracefully handles various error scenarios with helpful feedback.

## Installation

```bash
pip install komitto
```

For development installation, use:

```bash
pip install -e .
```

## Language Support

komitto automatically detects your language based on OS locale. Supported languages:
- English (`en`) – default
- Japanese (`ja`)

Set `KOMITTO_LANG=ja` to force Japanese.

## Usage

### Prompt Generation Mode (Default)

1. Stage changes with `git add`.
2. Run `komitto`.
3. The generated prompt is copied to your clipboard.

```bash
komitto
# -> Prompt copied!
```

### AI‑Automated Generation (Recommended when configured)

Configure `provider`, `model`, and other API settings in `komitto.toml`. Then running `komitto` will call the LLM, stream tokens, and copy the final commit message to the clipboard.

```bash
komitto
# -> 🤖 Generating...
# -> ✅ Copied!
```

### Interactive Mode

```bash
komitto -i
```

Available commands during the interactive loop:
- `y` – Accept and commit (`git commit -m <msg>`)
- `e` – Edit the message in an external editor
- `r` – Regenerate
- `n` or `Ctrl‑C` – Cancel

### Comparison Mode

Compare two different configurations side‑by‑side:

```bash
komitto --compare ctxA ctxB
```

Two columns are displayed; press `a` or `b` to select one, then commit or edit as usual.

### Passing Additional Context

Add free‑form context that will be merged into the prompt:

```bash
komitto "Urgent bug fix for payment processing"
```

### Editor Integration

During interactive mode you can invoke the configured editor at any time. The selection order is:
1. `$GIT_EDITOR`
2. `$VISUAL`
3. `$EDITOR`
4. Git’s built‑in default (`notepad` on Windows, `vi` otherwise).

## Customization via Configuration File

Create a project‑specific configuration with:

```bash
komitto init
```

Configuration files are looked up in this order (later overrides earlier):

1. User config directory (`%APPDATA%\komitto\config.toml`, etc.)
2. Project directory `./komitto.toml`

### Sample `komitto.toml`

```toml
[prompt]
system = """
You are a helpful assistant that produces semantic commit messages following Conventional Commits.
Analyze the diff below and output only the subject line (<=50 chars) and an optional body.
"""

[llm]
provider = "openai"
model = "gpt-4o"
api_key = "${OPENAI_API_KEY}"
base_url = "https://api.openai.com/v1"

history_limit = 5

[templates.simple]
system = "[{prompt}] Commit message: "

[contexts.release]
template = "simple"
model = "gpt4"

# Excludes are merged from defaults; add project‑specific patterns:
[git]
exclude = [
    "node_modules/**",
    "*.lock"
]
```

### Using Ollama/LM Studio

```toml
[llm]
provider = "openai"        # still used for compatibility layer
model = "qwen3"
base_url = "http://localhost:11434/v1"
# No api_key needed for most local setups
```

## How It Works (Internal Flow)

1. `git diff --staged` retrieves staged changes.
2. Differences are transformed into a structured representation (`file path | operation | surrounding function/class signatures`) in XML‑like format.
3. The configuration file defines a *system prompt*; this is merged with any user‑provided context and the diff representation to produce the final LLM input.
4. Depending on CLI flags, the tool either streams tokens live (Rich UI) or returns a complete string instantly.
5. The resulting text is copied to the clipboard; in interactive mode the user can accept, edit, regenerate, or cancel.
